<p>The choice of the name "Slightless" for a fashion and clothing app for the visually impaired holds a profound significance. The word "Slightless" cleverly combines "sight" and "less," encapsulating the essence of the app's purpose. By catering to individuals who may lack full sight, "Slightless" embodies the idea of transcending physical limitations and embracing inclusivity. It communicates the message that despite visual impairment, one can still engage with and enjoy fashion. Additionally, the name suggests a sense of empowerment, as users can navigate the world of fashion confidently and independently through the app, regardless of their visual abilities.
