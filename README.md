Welcome to the README for Sightless, the fashion app for the visually impaired. You’ve heard the saying, “Fashion is blind,” but that doesn’t mean it lacks style. Sightless embraces this idea, giving users the chance to impress with curated, stylish outfits based on surveys and expert input from top fashion designers.

The "Sightless" app is designed to make fashion more accessible for visually impaired users. It lets users organize their clothes in a digital closet, generates outfit ideas, and uses sound cues to describe clothing details. The app also helps locate nearby clothing stores and allows for interface customization.

The name "Sightless" combines "sight" and "less," emphasizing inclusion and confidence. Petra Huidink-de Jong, a blind accessibility expert, tested the app and appreciated its features. Her feedback, along with research on color coordination and fashion advice, helped improve the app’s recommendations, making it both trustworthy and easy to use.

<p>While some of Sightless' kinks are being worked on, there are two existing flows that can offer you the idea of how the app could potentially work. Make sure you choose "feestelijk" when you're in the `Creëer een Outfit` route. You can either go for a stylish blazer or for a more reminsicing christmas vibe.</p>
