<p>Welcome to the README for <b>Sightless</b>, the fashion and clothing app designed for the visually impaired. You've heard the old saying: 'Fashion is blind', but that doesn't mean it lacks style. <b>Sightless</b> challenges this notion, offering its users the opportunity to dazzle others with their fashionable outfits. Powered by <b>Sightless'</b> survey, curated by talented fashion designers.</p>

<p>Petra Huidink-de Jong, who was born blind. She navigates through several tools, including a braille keyboard and a screen reader. These devices are designed to convert visual designs into usable information for her. However, much is lost in translation because not everything can be converted, or it works very inefficiently. Petra works at <b>Cliëntenbelang Amsterdam</b> as a policy officer for Accessibility and Mobility and also runs her own translation agency. Additionally, she volunteers at the listening line and enjoys sports.</p>

<p>The choice of the name "Slightless" for a fashion and clothing app for the visually impaired holds a profound significance. The word "Slightless" cleverly combines "sight" and "less," encapsulating the essence of the app's purpose. By catering to individuals who may lack full sight, "Slightless" embodies the idea of transcending physical limitations and embracing inclusivity. It communicates the message that despite visual impairment, one can still engage with and enjoy fashion. Additionally, the name suggests a sense of empowerment, as users can navigate the world of fashion confidently and independently through the app, regardless of their visual abilities.

<p>Petra had the opportunity to test Sightless, providing valuable feedback and insights that I may have overlooked. She expressed satisfaction with the end result, mentioning that she would download Sightless if it were an actual app. Preferences vary, but Sightless provides feedback to users based on survey results from world-renowned fashionistas. Additionally, extensive research was conducted by visiting various fashion sites to understand color blending, fashion dos and don'ts, and more. These inputs influenced Sightless's algorithm to offer users a sense of security and trust.</p>

<p>While some of Sightless' kinks are being worked on, there are two existing flows that can offer you the idea of how the app could potentially work. Make sure you choose "feestelijk" when you're in the `Creëer een Outfit` route. You can either go for a stylish blazer or for a more reminsicing christmas vibe.</p>
